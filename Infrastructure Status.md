### Infrastructure Status

The current ZKM ecosystem requires a foundational monitoring system centered on a single-node Prometheus-Grafana deployment focusing on:

1. Performance Monitoring
   - Proof generation times and resource utilization
   - Memory consumption patterns during proving operations
   - CPU utilization across different proof types
   - Network latency and throughput measurements

2. System Analytics
   - Resource usage patterns
   - System bottleneck identification
   - Cost efficiency metrics
   - Scalability indicators
